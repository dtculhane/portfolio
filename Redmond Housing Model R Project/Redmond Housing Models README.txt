Redmond Housing Models README
David Culhane

This exercise was my first in creating models in R.

This script is intended to run alongside data provided by Bellevue University containing information about Redmond, WA's housing market. The data spans 2006-2016, containing multiple distinct housing market periods including the Great Recession. To provide a better analsis using linear regression modeling, the timespan was limited to 2014-2016. The models created were basic and multiple linear regressions. Additional steps, like standardization of data, would likely have contributed positively to the quality of the models and has been regularly done in projects undertaken after the completion of this one.
