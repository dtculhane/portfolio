He's at least 8 years old. Mary watches Leo when the family goes out of town. Leo doesn't like to be picked up. The Applicant wants a cat for Brandon  the 15-year-old  so he can have his own cat. Mary has adopted from us before ("Fitz"  name has changed to Samoa?) App works at Duke School of Medicine; Husband works for state  Brandon is good with Mary's cats. Mary seems a bit flaky.Julia  wrote on 3/23/2016: 3/17/16 - Reference check: Marissa DeLeo. She's 26 and known applicant since she was 7yo. App is friends with her mom from NY. Marley's Cat Tales did a photo shoot at her mom's house  Tammy Greco. Tammy did apps for Marley's. (See if anyone remembers her?) Marissa is a vet tech. Describes app as a hardworking mom. Brandon is a smart kid. Would help him socialize  he's a shy kid. He likes to play with Leo. The applicant had another cat almost 20 years ago  doesn't remember much about it.Julia  wrote on 3/23/2016: 3/18/2016 - Reference check: Deb Fidelman. Works with applicant for last 8 months. Applicant is awesome  kids are older  loving family  they dote on Leo. They're showing pics of Sit Thomas to people. The daughters are 18  one getting ready for college  the other is working. Down to earth  loving  active  family oriented. Brandon is a laid-back kid  loving  sensitive  empathetic  would dote over kitten. There was a cat behind app's house so they fed it until they found its owner. Fidelman volunteers with IAR (independent Animal Rescue).Julia  wrote on 3/23/2016: 3/17/16 - Call to applicant. Got clarity that they have 3 kids  not 2 as listed on the app. The 18 year olds are twins. Brandon  youngest  is 15. I asked about what the references had said that this would be "Brandon's cat". App verified  but acknowledged that everyone would be doting over it and caring for it. They are looking for a long-haired black cat that's loving  playful  affectionate  and Darcy caught their eye. Explained that Darcy is NONE of those things and he's a bad fit. Sir Thomas would be better. They're super eager to adopt and want to meet him right away. I explained that I had one more reference to check (Fidelman) and Leo has to be brought UTD on shots. She said that Leo didn't "need" vaccinations since he's inside only. She asked how much it would be; I said I don't know what their vet would charge them  and referred them to Carpenter. She said they'd get right on that.Julia  wrote on 3/23/2016: 3/21/16 - Shots updated - Applicant sent vet record that Leo got his Rabies  feline leukemia  FVRCP booster and a physical on 3/21/16 from Four Paws Animal Clinic (Chapel Hill - 919-942-1788). I called clinic and verified they'd been there.

I suggested Animall on Friday 3/25/2016. She said she'd bring her daughter (not sure which one). I asked if Brandon would be there. She said no  he's got soccer practice and they want to "surprise" him with the baby. I conferred with Carol H  and replied that "Surprise adoptions are against Calvin's Paws policy. Families with children under 18 have to meet the cat first to make sure everyone gets along. I'd love to schedule the meet and greet for a time when Brandon can be there." She came back with moving the meeting earlier  having her daughter bring Brandon there and meeting us there are 2:30. I have not yet responded.Julia  wrote on 3/24/2016: I had a long conversation with Carol H about my concerns about this app. We agreed to tell the applicant that I was adopting Sir Thomas  and Carol would communicate this to the applicant.

It sounds like you have put much thought into preparing for new cat additions to your family. We are always grateful when folks are willing to help a rescued kitty and help us save a life. Your application indicates that you intend to declaw your new cats and to let them go outside. Our policy prohibits us from adopting to any homes that may declaw an animal or to let them outside.We are a member of the Humane Society of the United States and follow the guidelines that they set out regarding optimal conditions for pets  and we base our policies on their research and recommendations. Since all of our kitties are in individual foster homes  we are all very attached and committed to their safety. Typically  domestic cats are declawed by pet owners who give the reason that they wish to protect their household furniture. They are seldom fully informed of the potential consequences of declawing by their veterinarians. Many people do not realize that declawing means the catâs toes are amputated at the last joint  taking out a portion of the bone  not just the nail. Declawing may result in permanent lameness  arthritis  pain  litter box aversion  behavior changes  and other long-term complications. Behavior problems in declawed house cats mean they are frequently relinquished to the "pound." With poor prospects of finding understanding new owners  these animals are usually killed.  Options other than declawing can be seen at www.declawing.com I understand that your opinion may vary from ours but if it does I do hope that you will still consider adopting a rescue cat/kitten. The local shelter euthanizes anywhere from 30 to 100 felines every day. Our goal is to reduce that number â whether you adopt from us or the shelter. They all deserve a chance.-- Julia EckardCalvin's Paws Adoption Counselorwww.calvinspaws.comJulia  wrote on 1/28/2016: denied appJulia  wrote on 1/28/2016: denied to due to intent to declaw and letting the outsideJulia  wrote on 1/28/2016: Changed Status from Under Review to Denied","4387592","Eckard"

Something didn't feel right so was t going to approve her until I could have help with questions I had for her. I asked Ana to talk to her (they happened to both be at Petsmart at the same time) So with an interpreter I found out that while she said our cat would be inside  she had been feeding 7-8 other cats  had cat trees in the house but they did come and go through a "cat door" she has. She would just watch the new cat to be sure it didn't get out with the others. Oh and by the way she lost one inside cat that way didn't watch carefully. ","4387594","Showalter"

The Robeson County Animal Shelter is a good place to start.Also  we highly recommend getting any of your current pets up-to-date on their vaccinations before adopting any new pets.

You will make a wonderful home for a kitty. It sounds like you have put much thought into preparing for this event. We are always grateful when folks are willing to help a rescued kitty and help us save a life. Your application indicates that you have cat doors in your home and your cats are allowed to go outside. We are a member of the Humane Society of the United States and follow the guidelines that they set out regarding optimal conditions for pets. Based on their research and recommendation  our current policy prohibits us from adopting to any homes that may allow their cats to go outside the home. Since all of our kitties are in individual foster homes  we are all very attached and committed to their safety. We understand that opinions may vary on this topic and know that there are many kittens out there that need a home. Your local shelter currently has a great number of cats and kittens. What is important to us is that you find the perfect match that will fit into your household. Thank you so much for taking the time to love on our kitties and show them interest. Congratulations to you in being ready for a new feline addition to your home. I know you will find the perfect match. And let us know any questions or thoughts you have on this issue. We appreciate you taking the time to review the information. Thank you so much for being willing to adopt a rescue kitty and help us save a life.Amy Edwards wrote on 3/18/2014: They have cat doors for their cats to go indoor outdoor.
