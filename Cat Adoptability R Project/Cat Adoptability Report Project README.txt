Cat Adoptability Report Project README

The Cat Adoptability Report is a statistical analysis conducted in R Studio of cat adoption from a Calvin's Paws, a rescue in North Carolina. The goal was to analyze factors inherent to the cats in the Calvin's Paws program to see what factors led to a cat being adopted faster or staying in the program longer. Factors like breed and fur color were identified to affect the amount of time a cat stayed in the rescue. The name of the cat was found to not have an effect. The thought with respect to names was that since Calvin's Paws lists their cats up for adoption in alphabetical order, cats with names higher up in the alphabet would be seen before those with names lower. This proved inconclusive.

The methods included in this analysis include data cleaning, statistical analysis, and textual analysis. Data cleaning included making sure data is of the appropriate type for each field and subsetting data where appropriate. Statistical analysis included analyzing histograms for subtypes and looking into summary statistics. Textual analysis looked into reasons why applications were denied.
