    "The last data component this project will be working with is data acquired via API call. Since this term project is looking at inflation rates around the world over the years, the data acquired through API call will pertain to inflation. Our flat data source had quarterly values of the consumer price index according to the World Bank and our web source was a wikitable of annual changes in the value of the consumer price index according to the United Nations. \n",

    "This doesn't leave a ton of options for more inflation data outside of contextual information. This context can be found using the NewsAPI, a REST API that can b used to search the internet for news articles. I have obtained a key for NewsAPI and can search for articles pertaining to inflation by using keywords and timeframes of publication. After acquiring data, TFIDF vectorization can be applied to find the important words in the articles found. This can be done fo each country and the results - the TFIDF matrices and lists of important words - can be stored in a dataframe.\n",

This function will want to take search parameters for a list of keywords (country, inflation) and timeframes (optional, using YYYY-MM-DD format).

    "***Conclusion and Ethical Implications of Analysis***\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This textual analysis had a number of hurdles the flat-source and online-source analyses didn't have to deal with. First off, the articles used for analysis depend entirely on how relevant NewAPI thinks the articles actually are. An example from testing the intial workings of this script is an excellent example. When using 'colombia' and 'inflation' as the keywords for NewsAPI. Using '+' can make sure a search term is included in the article and the top article with or without '+' for Colombia's search was an article about the Unied States Secret Service budget. This link allowed for text scraping and nothing short of manual exclusion would prevent the article, which had nothing to do with Colombia, from becoming part of the corpus of articles used in TFIDF analysis for Colombia's inflation articles. This means this script has less control than we like over what is actually pertaining to inflation and the country in question. This can be seen in the list of top words in the news_data dataframe.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A second concern is the limits on the number of calls that can be made to NewsAPI with free accounts. The initial purpose of this analysis was to see the scope of how inflation changed over time, going all the way back to 1970. A large number of countries didn't exist back then and experienced very different things at certain times, like post-Soviet and post-Yugoslavia countries. Being limited to only 50 API calls over a 12 hour period severely hampers the scope of this script as an academic assignment. If this analysis were being done over a long period of time, repeated sets of calls could be made on different days and the results could be saved to the computer running the function. This assignment is supposed to be run a single time and work as intended though, without saving data. This is a critical conflict that will limit the amount of contextual information allowed in the final product when all three datasets are put together (either as an intersection of all 3 datasets having only 50 countries or as an intersection of the first two datasets and union of that with this dataset).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The final concern with this script is its efficiency/timeliness. Looping through each country in a fifty country list and taking the steps being taken does require dedicated computing time. Unfortunately, I am not currently aware of ways in the code to force higher CPU usage in order to shorten computing time (like with the n_jobs parameter for various models). Taking the process used and applying it as a function with a lambda function mapped to the dataframe would be unlikely to remedy this issue.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "If this were being done in a busniess/commercial setting, the second problem could be done away with. That would be at a cost of at least $499/month though, something that is prohibitively expensive in an academic setting like this one.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "As of the writing of this conclusion, the process used for finding the top words according to TFIDF for each country's news query has hit its limit. I'm sincerely hoping that all possible errors have been identified but I can only hope that the code listed is robust enough. There is no more time to test it out fully. The limiting of data gathering to 50 countries is a by-product of running into the limits of a free account with NewsAPI. Before then, debugging work was being done on the code to make sure loops were being exited correctly for countries with less than 10 scrape-able articles and Armenia was being an issue. After that was fixed, Canada gave some context for additional errors that could be encountered before running out of queries for 12 hours. My current belief is that the code is now robust enough to move past errors but that is yet to be seen in an ethical manner (use of a naked except clause is discouraged but being done to try and make sure the process can be completed). A future running of this code to prepare for the merging may identify other problems that could be fixed post-submission to make sure a clean dataframe with news information is able to be used for merging with the other dataframes as a final product."
