    "This project looks to build a movie recommender system to be built from the MovieLens dataset. The data consists of four CSVs. The movies.csv file has movie IDs, titles, and genres. The links CSV has movie IDs, IMDB IDs, and TMDB IDs. The tags CSV has user IDs, movie IDs, user tags, and timestamps for when the tag was applied by the user. The ratings CSV has user IDs, movie IDs, ratings, and timestamps for when the rating was given by the user. The timestamps are the integer numbers of seconds since January 1st, 1970.\n",

    "The recommender system to be built will want to accept the name of a movie supplied by the user and then supply 10 recommendations for movies to watch. It will follow the system detailed at https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-mysteries/how-to-build-your-first-recommender-system-using-python-movielens-dataset/, part of this week's readings. In order to make sure that user input doesn't have to exactly match the titles in the data though, Jaccard Similarity will be calucalted using the user's input and each title in the data. This similarity will then select a title within the data to acquire recommendations."
