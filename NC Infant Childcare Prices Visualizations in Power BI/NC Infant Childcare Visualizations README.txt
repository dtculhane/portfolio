NC Infant Childcare Visualizations README
David Culhane

This project works with the US Department of Labor's National Database of Childcare Prices. The database itself has numerous fields with each of them explained in the accompanying PDF. The goal of the project was to create three displays of data in different mediums to make an argument by highlighting the high cost of infant childcare as a share of household income. The argument being made is for North Carolina voters and legislators to improve NC infant childcare costs.

The complete data was filtered for North Carolina data and subdivided into regions based in the ipynb file. In the ipynb file, information was gathered for counties and selected for the purposes of persuading voters via billboard and infographic as well as legislators by creating the regional datasets. The regional data was then each exported into a CSV and loaded into Power BI to create higher quality visualizations.

To declutter the data in Power BI, information showing significant costs was focussed on to present to legislators. All of the visualizations and data were then arranged for each medium in a PowerPoint format for submission. The billboard and infographic mediums could be separated out on their own at a later time.
