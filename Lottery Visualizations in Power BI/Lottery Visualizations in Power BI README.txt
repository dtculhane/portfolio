Lottery Visualizations in Power BI README
David Culhane

This project compares and highlights the differences between the Powerball, Mega Milions, and NY Pick 10 lotteries.

The DataCleaning script takes the three Excel workbooks containing the lottery data for each lottery and subdivides them into smaller Excel workbooks where each has a single piece of information to be used in Power BI.

With the data loaded into Power BI, changes to the Powerball and Mega Millions games over time are highlighted and argued as making the game less winnable by players since they wished to create higher jackpots. The fairness and stability of the NY Pick 10 lottery is highlighted and argued to be a better game for players, even if the prize payouts are smaller.
