Statistical Analysis of Cat Adoptability README
David Culhane

This statistical analysis was conducted using data from Calvin's Paws, a cat rescue group based out of Raleigh, NC. The goal was to analyze factors inherent to the cats in the Calvin's Paws program to see what factors led to a cat being adopted faster or staying in the program longer. Factors like breed and fur color were identified to affect the amount of time a cat stayed in the rescue. The name of the cat was found to not have an effect. The thought with respect to names was that since Calvin's Paws lists their cats up for adoption in alphabetical order, cats with names higher up in the alphabet would be seen before those with names lower. This proved inconclusive.

A significant majority of the code for this analysis came from the thinkstats2 library, which can be found at https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2. The code from the library allowed for easier use of CDF curves, PMF curves, survival curves, and statistical testing. Textual analysis was also conducted where possible to explore why applications for adoption were denied.

This project was also an early foray into pandas dataframes and series. This analysis allowed for much needed familiarization with the pandas library and was an important step in my learning process.
